My personal faves…
 
Move sidebar right. Do it. You know you want to.
Browser debugging. This is still the number 1 tip on vscodecandothat.com
Collapsible regions
Refactor promises to async/await
Using Emmet to Balance Inward/Outward and mapping that to a keyboard shortcut so it’s easier to select an entire element and all its contents
Soft Undo
Inline file and folder nesting (via simply changing the file/folder name)
Getting CSS/SCSS preview by mousing over the selector
Emmet’s Wrap individual lines
Emmet Update Image Size

docker debug, stream logs, ssh, etc
azure functions debug
prettier/eslint setup - people dig this. it's not easy to get it to work for everyone (conflicts with vscode settings too)
settings sync and settings.json (people like seeing settings they can grab)
shortcuts. people LOVE shortcuts
find references
Move to a new file / and how it changes import references
refactor require to import
